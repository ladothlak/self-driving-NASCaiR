# Using this script, you should be able to pass off play between yourself  #
# and DaiLE. DaiLE will control the vehicle at random intervals, and then  #
# you will control the car for a random interval--back and forth forever.  #
# This way, we can collect data for areas where DaiLE still seems to be    #
# struggling (e.g. getting stuck in the grass or taking a corner too       #
# aggressively)                                                            #
